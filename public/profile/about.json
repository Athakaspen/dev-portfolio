    "about": "College-certified software developer, self-trained game designer, and self-taught JP-EN Translator.\n\n\nI studied Computer Science at Missouri S&T University because I wanted to make video gamesâ€” and I made plenty! As president of the Game Development Club, I hosted Game Jams regularly, and published more than six independent games myself.\n\n\nIn addition to programming and game design, I self-studied Japanese for 4 years, finally passing the JLPT N1 in 2023. I've done contracted JP-EN translation for a large Japanese company on media including anime, games, and more.",
